# React GraphQL

- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
- We are using the _next_ version (2.x) of `react-scripts`, which gives us access to the `graphql-tag/loader`.
- Application is pretty straight forward, we use [`react-apollo`](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo) and [`apollo-boost`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/tree/master/packages/apollo-boost) to query our GraphQL server.
